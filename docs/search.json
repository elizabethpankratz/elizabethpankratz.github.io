    "text": "In a series of posts, I’m going to share my process for crafting a pair of handsewn, hand-welted leather derby boots.\nI’m absolutely not a shoemaking expert. I’m fully self-taught, and my process is a weird melange of professional bespoke techniques and idiosyncratic hacks. But I’ve been wearing the first pair of hand-welted derby boots I made every day for nearly a year, and they’re holding up really well. So whatever I’m doing is good enough for me!\nTo create my new derby boot pattern, I’m mostly following instructions from the book Handcraft Your Own Shoes and Boots by Neda Hussain. I’ve noted other useful references and sources for shoemaking materials at the bottom of the post."

    "section": "The process",
    "text": "The process\n\nCover the last (that is, the foot form) in masking tape and mark essential points.\nCut the tape off the last and stick each side flat onto paper to create the inside and outside forms.\nAverage out any wobbly bits to create the mean form.\nAdd on design lines to create the standard form.\nUsing the standard form, create pattern pieces.\n\n\n1. Taping the last\nOverall, what I’m doing here is moving from the 3D shape of a last down to a 2D representation. Covering the last in masking tape, then cutting the tape off and sticking it down flat onto some card, gives me a decent approximation of the curves and contours of the foot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are my lasts! Only one needs to be taped up if they’re approximately the same shape. I’ve augmented them with cork where my feet are wider and rasped and sanded them down where my feet are smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last covered in masking tape. I’ve marked a line down the centre of the foot (and out of view, another black line marks the centre of the heel).\n\n\nI marked the centre lines down the front and heel, as well as the “vamp point”: the widest point of the last measured from the ball of the foot across to the pinky knuckle. This is also the point where the “quarters” end and the “vamp” begins. The “quarters” are the pieces on each side of the foot and ankle that meet the strap at the centre back and hold all the eyelets for the laces on either side of the front. The “vamp” is the piece that joins the toe cap in the front, curves around the sides of the foot to lie below the quarters, and extends upwards between the quarters to make the tongue.\n\n\n2. Getting the inside and outside forms\nI also marked the “counter point” CP on the heel, sliced the tape along those two centre lines, and stuck each half down onto card and cut them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tape has been peeled off of the last and stuck down onto card. The VP (“vamp point”) and CP (“counter point”) have been marked on tthe instep and heel respectively.\n\n\nGetting the tape approximately flat is good enough for most of the foot—those wrinkles aren’t the end of the world. But small slices around the outside edge are essential to help the toe lie down smoothly.\n\n\n3. Finding the mean form\nThe mean form is so called because it’s the mean, i.e., average, of the inside and outside forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the last to the mean form: a 2D representation of its shape!\n\n\nI overlaid the inside and outside forms on another piece of card and traced around each of them. Then I marked the line that falls in between each of those outlines and cut along it (except for the bottom front of the foot—there I kept the full width of the outside form).\nI only need to do all this once. Now that I have the mean form, I can use it as the basis for every pair of shoes I design for this last from now on.\n\n\n4. Creating the standard form\nHere’s where things get design-specific and the shape of the derby boot starts to emerge!\nThis step involves tracing the mean form onto another piece of paper, marking a bunch of points in particular locations, and drawing a bunch of lines between them at specific angles and with specific lengths. I leaned heavily on the Hussain book here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard form is like the first mock-up of the shoe pattern. It’s the basis for making all the individual pattern pieces.\n\n\nOne place I diverged from the Hussain book: that book is written for making shoes using the stitch-down construction (i.e., the upper of the shoe is sewn directly onto the midsole), a construction that’s easier to sew but a lot harder to resole. I’m going to hand-welt my shoes instead (see this Shoegazing post on different construction methods). Hand-welting requires the lasting allowance around the bottom edge to be a lot more generous than stitch-down requires its seam allowance to be. I used 25 mm total.\n\n\n5. Getting the pattern pieces\nFinally, I followed the Hussain book to derive from the standard form the four pattern pieces I’ll cut from my leather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four pattern pieces for my derby boots: heel counter with back strap (top left), toe cap (top right), quarters (bottom right), and vamp (bottom left).\n\n\nFor easier tracing, I glued the paper pieces onto card (sourced from a recycled folder, hence the funny ridges!).\nThat’s all for now :)"

A piece that’s aligned with the grain doesn’t stretch, while a piece on the bias (45 degrees to the grain) does. It turns out that shoemakers have to do something similar!\nLeather hides also have stretch, but unlike fabric, this stretch goes in different directions on different parts of the hide. And the pattern pieces need to be cut from a part of the hide that puts the stretch in the right places.\nBack when I was making my first pair of shoes, I created these diagrams that summarised information about leather stretch that I found online (click to view larger).\n\n\n\nThe top diagram labels the parts of a hide—shoulder, bend, butt, and belly—and indicates which way the stretch of each part runs. The bottom diagram shows how the stretch should be laid out on the foot: you want side-to-side stretching across the front of the foot, and vertical stretching around the heel.\n\n\nTaking this stretch into account, I traced my pattern pieces using silver pen onto the hides and cut them out (again, click to view each picture larger).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leather used for the outer layer of the boot is 1.4–1.6 mm thick calf leather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had to work really hard to remember to cut two mirrored versions of each piece!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lining is &lt;1 mm thick pig skin suede velour.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’d estimate that these boots used up about five square feet each of the outer leather and of the lining leather."

But it also refers to shaving down the edges of the leather pieces in areas where they’ll overlap, so that when they’re sewn together, the final piece will have a consistent thickness.\nBeginner kits will often come with “safety skivers”, tools that put razor blades at awkward angles so they’re far away from your fingers. They may be safe, but they’re also really annoying to use. I got so fed up with my safety skivers during my last pair of boots that I went and bought this definitely-not-safety knife and a whetstone, and boy is that an improvement! A properly sharp knife actually makes skiving fun.\n\n\n\nI skived down the areas of underlay on the vamp (and the quarters, not pictured), gradually thinning the leather from about 10 mm in.\n\n\nHere’s another skiving tip that improved my life (picked up from the Carreducker blog): skive onto a glass surface. The knife won’t chew through the glass the way it will a cutting mat. I just use the glass from a thrifted picture frame."

But thanks to the reinforcement tape I’d used, the back heel of the boot didn’t totally fall apart then and there, and I was able to sew it all shut before the heel got any more damaged."

I find their technical names charming: we’ve got a heel counter and a toe puff.\nIn my last pair of boots, I used stiffeners from I Can Make Shoes that are made out of thermoplastic. They do the trick, and it’s fun to use a heat gun to shape them, but they aren’t the most robust to lots of wear. I found that the heel counter in particular has gotten some cracks. So now I’m doing what the fancy professionals do: making my own stiffeners out of leather.\nI approximated the size and shape based on the boot’s pattern pieces and cut two of each out of 3 mm thick veg tan leather. The edges have to be dramatically skived down to nearly nothing so that no lumps and bumps show through to the outside of the boot. Luckily I enjoy skiving now, so this step was actually pretty satisfying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the glass base that has improved my skiving experience so much!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I’ve glued the stiffeners onto the flesh sides of the outers."

    "section": "The insoles",
    "text": "The insoles\nThe insoles are not just the layer on which the foot will rest—they’re also the anchor that’ll hold the whole shoe together.\nThe first step is to block the insoles to the bottom of the last so that the leather begins to take on the curve of the sole. I cut some generously sized pieces of 3 mm veg tan leather, immersed them in water, let them dry until they were just a little bendy, scraped the skin side with a piece of glass (glassing removes the outermost surface to hopefully lessen squeaking as I walk), and nailed the pieces onto the last.\n\n\n\nThe veg tan leather is nailed skin side up to the insole. The nails around the edge help force the leather up against the “feather edge”, the bottom perimeter of the last.\n\n\nBeing able to find the feather edge is crucial, because the next step is to trim away the overhang. The result should be two pieces that curve along with the last’s sole and mirror the taper and flare of the feather edge.\n\n\n\nA still life of my workshop table in my favourite state: mid-task, with tools scattered everywhere. This shot shows the blocked insoles trimmed to the feather edge of the last.\n\n\nAfter trimming, I also bevelled the upper edge of the insole. Otherwise the harsh edge would be uncomfortable on my feet.\nNow to create the structure that will allow the upper to be joined to the insole: the holdfast. The holdfast is formed by relief carving into the insole, defining a ridge that runs around the bottom of the foot.\nI first marked the distance from the feather edge to where the outer edge of the holdfast should be. This distance is typically 5 mm, except it’s 10 mm at the crest of the inner waist (that is, the inside arch of the foot) and 7 mm at the outer waist, the toe, and the heel. Then I connected these points and used my dividers to mark a 6 mm strip around the whole insole.\n\n\n\nThe holdfast is 6 mm wide and encircles the entire foot. Some shoemakers anchor the heel in other ways, so this 360-degree holdfast is not ubiquitous. But I like my boots chunky, so this is what works for me!\n\n\nThen, very carefully, I carved about 1.5 mm into the insole on either side of these lines. The channel around the inner line slopes downward downward from the centre of the insole, while around the outer line, I can just cut straight in from the outside edge.\n\n\n\nFor precision cutting like this, I find it useful to switch between a craft knife and a skiving knife. Having a strop on hand to keep the blades sharp is a must. Here the 1.5 mm deep holdfasts have been carved out of the 3 mm thick insole, and unlike my previous pair of boots, I didn’t cut through to the last at all! 🥳\n\n\nI believe the professionals like Carreducker use leather that’s 6 mm thick for their insoles. The extra thickness would give a bit more leeway in carving the holdfasts, but in terms of sturdiness, even these relatively shallow holdfasts haven’t let me down.\nSoon, once the boots are lasted, I will stitch through the holdfasts and the uppers (and the welts—see below!). To prepare for the stitching, I marked around the holdfast where the thread will pass through. The stitches should be spaced about 8 mm apart on the outside of the holdfast, so they’ll cluster more tightly inside the curves of the toe and heel.\n\n\n\nBoth inside and outside curves have been marked to define where, soon, stitching will anchor welts and outers through the holdfast.\n\n\nFinally, I used my welting awl (slightly curved) to punch holes through the holdfast at every line I marked. This’ll make the stitching much easier later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe welting awl punches the paths through the holdfast that the thread will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll punched and ready for stitching!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Shoe aficionados may have encountered the term “Goodyear welted”. Goodyear welting is related to hand welting, just the holdfast is made of canvas glued to the underside of the insole, not carved out of the insole itself.)"

    "text": "Welting\nTime for the number one trickiest part of the whole process: connecting the welt strips to the boots by stitching through them, the upper, and the holdfast.\n\n\n\nI’d previously blocked the welts into curves by soaking them, shaping them into circles, and letting them dry. I also wear my old cycling gloves while welting, because the stitches need to be pulled tight, and without the gloves, the thread will cut into my skin.\n\n\nI began attaching the welts at the inside waist of each boot, the least visible spot. For each stitch, I put my welting awl through a pre-existing hole in the holdfast and punched through the feather edge of the glued-down upper. Then I used a separate awl to perforate the welt strip in the right spot (having two awls was a lot easier than making my poor welting awl do all the work). Then I saddle stitched with curved upholstery needles through all those cumbersome layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDual awl action: the welting awl is on the right, going through the holdfast and the outer, while my favourite straight awl on the left is opening up the corresponding spot in the welt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s impossible to sew these welts with straight needles. The professionals use bristles, long bendy things, but these curved upholstery needles work OK for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took me a full Saturday to welt both boots, partly because I snapped one of the upholstery needles—which should give you a sense of how much muscle this job takes—and I had to run out to the hardware shop to get another.\n\n\n\nAnother little still life moment halfway through the second boot. (I did most of the welting sitting on the floor.)\n\n\nAfter the welts were all sewn on, I got them wet with a toothbrush and then hammered them down on both sides. Hammering from the bottom helps the bevelled “seam allowance” to sit flush against the uppers, and hammering from the top helps the strip stick out at 90-ish degrees from the feather edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth welts are on! This picture was taken before the welts were hammered flat, so they’re still angled toward the upper, the way they were sewn on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hammering, the welts stick out horizontally around the feather edge. The boots are really starting to come together!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo happy to be finished welting!! Now we’re on the home stretch, and next up are the soles 🥳\n\n\n\nThe pre-lasted boots, all done up with placeholder laces.\nAfter a lot of wrangling, I got the uppers pulled over the lasts and nailed in place.\nThe nail density correlates directly with how tricky it is to get each section to lie flat at the feather edge! This view also shows clearly the little triangles sticking out from the upper’s lower edge on the inside of the foot.\nWhat’s left after all the pleats are skived down.

    "text": "Lasting\nNow that I’ve blocked the insoles and carved out the holdfasts, I’m finally ready to last the uppers—that is, to pull the leather that’ll cover the foot over the last and anchor it down.\n(Supposedly one should be making boots on boot lasts that have higher ankles, but my previous pair of boots came out just fine on these basic shoe lasts, so 🤷🏻‍♀)\nI can tell which upper is destined for which last because when cutting out the pattern pieces, I left little triangles sticking out at the bottom of each piece that goes on the inside of the foot. (If you revisit the pictures in this previous post, it’s for this reason that some pattern pieces but not others have extra little triangles on their bottom edges!)\nTo begin, I drenched the lasts and the insides of the uppers in baby powder. The idea is that the powder will help the lasts slip out more easily after the boots have been built.\nNext, I “pre-lasted” the uppers by nailing them sparsely to the bottom of the last, not pulling too tight, just letting the leather get to know the shape it will take on before the hard work of proper lasting begins. I left the boots sitting like this for a couple days.\n\n\n\nThe pre-lasted boots, all done up with placeholder laces.\n\n\nTo anchor the back of the boot to the back of the last, when lasting my previous pair of boots, I had put one nail straight through the heel cap into the last. Seemingly this is a controversial practice, so I experimented with not doing it this time, but I regret that choice—the heel of the last didn’t stay in place very well, there was too much vertical play, so lasting the heels was a challenge. (Maybe this is one reason why boot lasts can useful?) So, note to future self: for me, the heel nail is a good move.\nI unfortunately fully forgot to take any pictures while actually lasting the boots! The process looked like this: me, hunched over an upside-down boot in my lap, using lasting pliers to yank on the bottom edge of the upper leather, pulling it as far toward the centre line as I could before nailing each bit in place. Even though it’s a lot of work, it does make you feel like a real cobbler.\n\n\n\nAfter a lot of wrangling, I got the uppers pulled over the lasts and nailed in place.\n\n\nAs you can probably imagine, excess leather really bunches up around the toe and the heel, so those areas require extra care (and extra nails).\n\n\n\nThe nail density correlates directly with how tricky it is to get each section to lie flat at the feather edge! This view also shows clearly the little triangles sticking out from the upper’s lower edge on the inside of the foot.\n\n\nDespite all those nails, the toes still turned out a bit puckered above the feather edge, but honestly I don’t really mind. All these organic “imperfections” show that these boots came from the hands of an artisan and not from a machine.\nAfter lasting, I glued down the edges of the uppers, and once the glue was dry, I pulled out the nails and skived the big pleats flat.1\n\n\n\nWhat’s left after all the pleats are skived down. The result doesn’t need to be perfectly flat, but welting will be easier if most of the bulk is out of the way."

For example, “Shane just broke the vase, but it is not broken” is no good. “I skived the pleats, but they’re not skived” also sounds pretty bad, and the more general “I skived the pleats, but nothing’s different about them” doesn’t work either. +1 to Result.\nIf skive is a result verb, we shouldn’t be able to delete its object. For example, “All last night, Shane broke” isn’t good without “the vase”. So let’s try: “All last night, I skived”. Actually seems OK? +1 to Manner.\nIf skive is a result verb, we shouldn’t be able to use out-prefixation. For example, “Shane out-broke the other vase smashers” is pretty weird. But “I out-skived the other leatherworkers” is OK to me. +1 to Manner.\nIf skive is a manner verb, only a particular kind of actor should be able to do it. (In contrast, result verbs are OK in both “Shane broke the vase” and “The vase broke”). And “The leather skived” is definitely bad. +1 to Manner.\nIf skive is a manner verb, it should be bad when followed by “but didn’t move a muscle”, because probably an action is involved. “I skived the leather but didn’t move a muscle” 👎🏻. +1 to Manner.\n\nSo I guess skive is overall fairly well-Mannered, but with a bit of spice when it comes to result entailment?↩︎"

    "text": "Filling in the insole\nPicking up where we left off, with the boot freshly welted, the bottom of the foot isn’t quite level: the middle sits several millimetres lower than the sole’s perimeter. Not so good as a surface to glue a midsole onto! So the first thing to do is to build up the hollow centre so the surface is even.\nIt’s at this stage that some shoemakers will attach a shank: a stiff piece of metal, wood, or sole bend leather that sits beneath the arch and keeps the shoe from collapsing. A shank is crucial if the shoe will have a substantial heel drop, but for a flat style like this one, I’ve found that my boots hold up just fine without. So I just filled up the sole with a hodgepodge of scrap leather.\n\n\n\nIt was very pleasing to finally use some of the oddly-shaped bits from my scrap hoard!"

    "section": "The midsole",
    "text": "The midsole\nWith the bottom of the foot nice and flat, the midsole can now be glued on.\nI cut generous midsoles out of 3 mm veg tan leather, a few millimetres larger than the circumference of the welt all around. Then I used my roughening tool (Carreducker call it the “killer toothbrush”) to scratch up the skin side so that it’s more receptive to glue and (hopefully) won’t rub against the insole leather and start to squeak.\n\n\n\nThe killer toothbrush makes short work of the midsole’s skin side 😬\n\n\nThen I glued the midsoles onto the boots, skin side up, and carefully trimmed the edges down to match the exact circumference of the welts.\n\n\n\nMidsoles are on and trimmed! The goal of the masking tape above the welt is to protect the upper leather during the soling process.\n\n\nTime to stitch!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI used my dividers to mark a stitching line about 3 mm from the edge of the welt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this line with a tracing wheel from my sewing kit, I can get evenly-spaced marks. They’re denser than they need to be, though, so…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… I used my stitching awl to punch through every second one. This photo also shows where the two ends of the welt meet at the inside waist. The sole stitching will span this join and hold the two ends together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI saddle stitched through the welt and midsole. After wrestling with the welts, the sole stitching is a relief!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the sole stitching complete, the midsoles are attached with both glue and thread.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an aside: at this point, I can most clearly illustrate why the hand-welted construction is so good for resoling. Should these boots ever need resoled, it’s this thread that would be cut through to detach the midsole from the uppers. But the welts would stay in place, and therefore so would the uppers, since they’re sandwiched in between the welts and the holdfasts. The fit of the shoe would therefore also stay exactly the same. Compare this to a stitchdown construction, where the upper is sewn directly onto the midsole, with no mediating welt. There, undoing those stitches means that the upper is free-floating and would need to be lasted again to be sewn onto the new sole, and re-lasting the upper could potentially change the shoes’ fit.\nOK, back onto the rails! The last step before moving on to the outsole is to finish the exposed leather of the welt and the midsole. I like leaving the veg tan undyed, because it ages and takes colour so beautifully through wear, but I did sand it down and then burnish it for some light protection using Tokonole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokonole is a burnishing paste containing glue that sinks into the leather fibre and wax that polishes to a lovely shine on the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the left half of this picture, the sole edges are still raw; on the right, they’ve been lightly burnished with Tokonole and a canvas cloth. The new saturated colour is so beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\nI applied the Tokonole on top of the welts and all around the soles’ perimeters. Because those surfaces are flat, I had most success burnishing them with a piece of canvas cloth rather than the burnisher tool.\n\n\n\nEt voila, sole stitching and edge finishing are complete!\n\n\nNote: Because I’m applying a sole unit that covers the entire bottom of the foot, I attached the midsole with its skin side up. But if I were applying smaller, separate sole pieces that left some of the midsole exposed, I would have attached it skin side down and used Tokonole to finish any parts left uncovered."

    "text": "The outsole\nSpeaking of the sole unit, here’s what we’re working with:\n\n\n\nA proper Vibram sole unit—I decided to treat myself.\n\n\nI intentionally ordered sole units that are a bit oversized—size 41/42 for my 39/40—so that the width would be right. But of course, they’re a bit too long, so I had to trim the toe and heel down to the true size of the boot, which I traced on with silver pen.\n\n\n\nTrimming the sole units down to size was really hard work! My triceps were sore for a good few days afterward. Another tricky thing is that the rubber can’t really be sanded down, so all the cuts have to be as smooth as possible. (Let’s call the jagged, angular cuts on the heel my signature look…)\n\n\nOnce the outsoles were the right size, I glued them onto the flesh side of the midsoles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis water-based glue is fine to hold things in place temporarily, but it’s definitely not strong enough on its own to attach the outsoles permanently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the outsole properly, I used a bunch of brass screws. Make sure not to screw into the last!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, with the soles all finished, the boots are ready to come off of the lasts! 🥳 An enormous milestone!\nWith the last out, here’s how the insole looks from the top:\n\n\n\nThe insole still shows all the little nail holes from blocking and lasting. I think it’s really lovely. Another mark of the hand.\n\n\nAll the white dust in the picture above is the baby powder I added so that removing the last would be easier—and it worked!\nOne of the last steps is to cover up this raw insole with another shoe component with a silly name: the insock.\n\n\n\nThe insock is the bit of leather that’s actually in contact with the bottom of your foot. I like it when they’re a bit bigger than the sole so that they cover the gap between insole and boot lining. I conveniently found a couple insocks lying around that had been cut from the lining leather of my previous pair of boots. Thanks past Elizabeth!\n\n\nI glued the insocks down inside the boots, and with that, they were done!\n… Or so I thought, until I took them walking on a hot day and the heels of the outsoles peeled off 🙃 I guess the temperatures softened the glue, and two screws weren’t enough to hold each heel on. So when I got home, I sent a bunch of screws down from the insole into the solid rubber around the outside of the heels.\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world, I’d have screwed the heel on before gluing down the insock. But this solution is surprisingly fine—my feet don’t notice the screw heads at all.\n\n\nOK, and with that, they really are done 🥰\n\n\n\nMy newest pride and joy: a finished pair of handmade derby boots.️\n\n\nCreating my own shoes is magic.\nI really used to think it was normal that a new pair of leather shoes would cause months of blisters and pain before they started feeling okay. Making shoes has shown me that commercial footwear just isn’t made for feet shaped like mine. Which is wild, because my feet are so normal?! I could go on about that for a long time, but suffice it to say: what a difference to put on my beautiful bespoke, handmade boots. They fit perfectly right away. And with the right care, they’ll last me forever. Magic, I say!\nThanks for following along ❤️"

Year 2 (pink) shows a slight a drop-off over time. Then Year 3 (blue) was pretty stable, and Year 4 (orange) started with some vigorous experiment-running and thesis-writing, then decreased quickly as the PhD reached an end.\nThe violins in the lower plot aggregate the data for each year. They show that in Years 1 and 2, I worked too long too often—I’m glad I got that impulse under control for Years 3 and 4.\n\n\nCode\nhrs_daily |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    mean_daily   = round(mean(daily_hrs), 1),\n    median_daily = round(median(daily_hrs), 1),\n    min_daily    = round(min(daily_hrs), 2),\n    max_daily    = round(max(daily_hrs), 1)\n  ) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_daily\nmedian_daily\nmin_daily\nmax_daily\n\n\n\n\n5.2\n5.4\n0.08\n11.5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOverall, on average I spent 5.2 hours per day focused on PhD work. My median work day was 5.4 hours. My shortest work day was five minutes (lol), and my longest work day was 11.5 hours (bad. don’t do this).\n\n\nHow many hours per task type?\nMy work fell into five broad categories:\n\nAdmin: Covers misc set-up and bureaucracy around the PhD, as well as my admin tasks within my research group.\nCommunity: Covers reading groups, talk series, and conferences/workshops.\nCoursework: Covers the required courses that were a condition of my funding as well as courses I audited for fun.\nResearch: Covers reading the literature, designing and implementing experiments and models, writing everything up, preparing talks, and the PhD examination process.\nTeaching: Covers tutoring, guest lecturing, my one-on-one stats chats sessions, and working toward my AFHEA accreditation.\n\n\n\nCode\nhrs |&gt;\n  group_by(tasktype) |&gt;\n  summarise(hrs = sum(mins)/60) |&gt;\n  arrange(hrs) |&gt;\n  mutate(tasktype = factor(tasktype, levels = tasktype)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = tasktype, x = hrs, fill = tasktype)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(\n      label = round(hrs), \n      x = hrs + (15 * log(hrs))  # scale the spacing by magnitude of hrs\n    ), family = 'Fira Sans') +\n  labs(\n    y = element_blank(),\n    x = 'Total hours'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'none'\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(palette_tasktype[1], palette_tasktype[3], palette_tasktype[2], palette_tasktype[5], palette_tasktype[4]))+\n  NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks about right! Lots and lots of research, plenty of teaching and community engagement, a bit of course work, with admin sitting blissfully in last place.\n\n\nTask types over time\n\n\nCode\nhrs |&gt;\n  group_by(month_idx, tasktype, year) |&gt;\n  summarise(hrs = sum(mins)/60) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = month_idx, y = hrs, fill = tasktype)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'stack') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(5, 17, 29, 41), labels = c(2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)) +\n  labs(\n    y = 'Hours/\\nmonth',\n    x = element_blank(),\n    fill = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_tasktype) +\n  NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did a lot of tasks pretty regularly across the whole four years: regular admin, regular community engagement, regular research. The big swaths of yellow coursework in the beginning were my required courses, and the for-fun auditing happened toward the end.\nThe big red spike of teaching in early 2023 is when I stepped in to design and run the last several weeks of a PG-level Bayesian stats course. That was such a fun and formative experience—it’s hard to believe that it was more than half a PhD ago.\n\n\nHow many hours per research project?\nI conducted four research projects during the PhD, and each project makes up one content chapter in my thesis.\n \n\n\n\nA schematic illustrating the language acquisition phenomena I investigated in my thesis.\n\n\n \nMy time on these projects was lumped together under the Research task type I plotted above, but of course I also recorded how much time I spent on each project individually.\n\n\nCode\nmain_projs &lt;- c('Word segmentation', 'Rule learning',  'Rule generalisation',  'Rule structure generalisation')\n\nhrs |&gt;\n  filter(tasklabel %in% main_projs) |&gt; \n  group_by(tasklabel) |&gt;\n  summarise(hrs = sum(mins)/60) |&gt;\n  arrange(hrs) |&gt;\n  mutate(tasklabel = factor(tasklabel, levels = tasklabel)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = tasklabel, x = hrs, fill = tasklabel)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(\n      label = round(hrs), \n      x = hrs + 30\n    ), family = 'Fira Sans') +\n  labs(\n    y = element_blank(),\n    x = 'Total hours'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'none'\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(palette_proj[2], palette_proj[4], palette_proj[1], palette_proj[3])) +\n  NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI always knew that the Rule generalisation project (green, Chapter 4) was closest to my heart, but I’m still amused to see that I dedicated more than double as much time to it as to any of the others.\n\n\nResearch projects over time\nOne of the plots I was most curious to generate was this next one.\n\n\nCode\nhrs |&gt;\n  filter(tasklabel %in% main_projs) |&gt;\n  group_by(month_idx, tasklabel, year) |&gt;\n  summarise(hrs = sum(mins)/60) |&gt;\n  mutate(tasklabel = factor(tasklabel, levels = main_projs)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = month_idx, y = hrs, fill = tasklabel)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'stack') +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(5, 17, 29, 41), \n    labels = c(2022, 2023, 2024, 2025),\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_proj) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    y = 'Hours/\\nmonth',\n    x = element_blank(),\n    fill = element_blank(),\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    fill=guide_legend(nrow=2),\n    ) +\n  NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Word segmentation project (red, Chapter 2) was my first-year project, and it grew up to become Pankratz et al., (2024). For this project, I ran one experiment in July 2022. The manuscript was submitted in late 2022, and the splashes of red in 2023 were the revisions following peer review. Then in early 2024 came the final formatting checks, and then the paper was out!\nThe Rule learning project (yellow, Chapter 3), which I did together with Aislinn Keogh, is the longest-running project of the four. We ran two experiments, one in April 2023 and one almost a year later in March 2024. This project never got published, but it appears as a chapter in each of our PhD theses.\nThe Rule generalisation project (green, Chapter 4) consumed my time and my thinking for much of 2023 and well into 2024. I consider it the heart of my PhD—it’s the project I find the most interesting and the most compelling. Which explains why I spent 661 hours on it! The project did have some false starts, though. I ran one experiment for it in October 2022, but that experiment never saw the light of day because of confounds in the design that I detected too late. A second experiment, the one that actually appears in the thesis, was run in July 2023.\nFinally, the Rule structure generalisation project (blue, Chapter 5) was my main focus in my final year. For this project, I ran four experiments within three months: one in June 2024, two in August, and one in September. Those four experiments were all pretty similar, but still, four experiments in three months is serious progress, considering I spent my entire first year on one single experiment! Turns out a PhD does actually teach you things. Who knew?\n\n\nThesis writing and viva prep\nIn addition to the four content chapters, my thesis contains an introduction chapter, a general discussion chapter, and a bunch of appendices. The time I spent planning, writing, and revising that thesis-specific material was recorded as Thesis time. Thesis time also contains hours spent on LaTeX tomfoolery and on implementing the minor corrections after my viva.\nUnder Viva time, I counted the hours I spent designing my pre-viva talk (which is probably my favourite talk I’ve ever given) as well as doing more traditional prep for the viva itself. Here I’ll plug Nathan Ryder’s Viva Survivors web site and workshop, and especially the 7776 Mini-Vivas resource. Doing a mock viva using that resource was the most useful part of my prep by a mile.\n\n\nCode\nhrs |&gt;\n  filter(tasklabel %in% c('Thesis', 'Viva')) |&gt;\n  group_by(tasklabel) |&gt;\n  summarise(hrs = round(sum(mins)/60)) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\ntasklabel\nhrs\n\n\n\n\nThesis\n235\n\n\nViva\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll in all, I spent 235 hours on thesis-specific tasks and 55 hours creating the pre-viva talk and preparing for the viva itself.\nHere’s how those hours played out over time:\n\n\nCode\nhrs |&gt;\n  filter(tasklabel %in% c('Thesis', 'Viva')) |&gt;\n  group_by(week_idx, tasklabel, year) |&gt;\n  summarise(hrs = sum(mins)/60) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = week_idx, y = hrs, fill = tasklabel)) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 175, colour = palette_exam[1], linetype = 'dashed') +\n  geom_text(x = 175.5, y = 35, label = 'Thesis submitted on 6 Jan 2025', hjust = 0, family = 'Fira Sans', colour = palette_exam[1]) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 180, colour = palette_exam[2], linetype = 'dashed') +\n  geom_text(x = 180.5, y = 30, label = 'Viva on 11 Feb 2025', hjust = 0, family = 'Fira Sans', colour = palette_exam[2]) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'stack') +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(153, 157, 161, 165, 170, 174, 179, 183, 187),\n    labels = c('Aug 2024', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr 2025'),\n    limits = c(152, 189)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_exam) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = palette_exam) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    y = 'Hours/\\nweek',\n    x = element_blank(),\n    fill = element_blank(),\n  ) +\n  NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI spent most of November and December writing. After a week off during the holidays, the thesis was ready to submit by early January, and then I turned immediately to preparing for the viva in mid-February.\nFollowing the viva, I took a month to prepare for a job interview, and then in April I picked up the thesis again and worked on my corrections for two relaxed weeks. Those corrections were submitted on 9 April and approved on 15 April, and now, 242,516 minutes later, I can call myself Doctor 😊\n\n\nEpilogue: Citation frequencies\nAs a cherry on top, I wanted to look at how often I cited each piece of literature. Each citation is itemised in the .bcf file produced by biblatex. And, surprise surprise, Zipf appears both in name and in rank/frequency law:\n\n\nCode\nbcf &lt;- xml2::read_xml('data/output.bcf')\ncitekeys &lt;- xml2::xml_text(xml2::xml_find_all(bcf, \".//bcf:citekey\"))\nrefs_freqdist &lt;- as.data.frame(table(citekeys)) %&gt;% \n  arrange(Freq) %&gt;% \n  mutate(citekeys = factor(citekeys, levels = citekeys))\n\nrefs_freqdist %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Freq, y = citekeys)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +\n  labs(\n    y = element_blank(),\n    x = 'Frequency'\n    ) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=6)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(position = 'top') +\n  NULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Zipf, 1949 shows up in Rank 49 with a frequency of 5.)\nAppropriately, considering my PhD was about how distributional statistics affect language learning, my top five sources are:\n\nSaffran, J.

We’ll call these the singletons, and we’ll set them aside until the next step.\nIterate over the students who did put down UUNs they want to work with.\n\nFor each student i:\n\nFor each of their chosen UUNs j:\n\nPut i and j in a temp-group together if j also chose i.\n\n\n\nRecord each of the temp-groups that emerge through this mutual choosing process. If a student’s UUN has already been added to a temp-group, then they don’t need to be looked at again. As such, the process goes surprisingly quickly. And through this process, people will nearly always be teamed up with at least one person they chose.\nAn exception I observed: Student A only chose one other person, Student B, but B was already in a fully mutual five-by-five mapping with four other students. I gave the fully mutual five-by-five team priority. And I could resolve the case for Student A because luckily, there was a Student C who had asked to work with Student A. So this allowed us to say: “you are in a team with at least one person you chose and/or with at least one person who wanted to work with you”.\nWhen the process above results in a temp-group of the maximum size, then you can finalise that team.\n(Sometimes the process resulted in a temp-group that exceed the max size, because I was sloppy about data entry. If you limit the number of UUNs that can be entered, then you won’t have this problem. I solved it by splitting the too-big temp-group into two smaller temp-groups.)\nIf the process results in temp-groups that are smaller than the desired size, then we merge temp-groups and add in singletons (people who didn’t enter any UUNs they wanted to work with) based on their skill rankings."

We won’t read any of the group discussions, so feel free to use it however you wish, but we’ve also provided a list of every team member’s email address if you want to take things outside of Learn.\n\nAnd each team got a message something like the following:\n\nHello! Your team is the SILLY TEAM NAME HERE!\nTeams for DAPR3 have been finalised, and you can find details of your team members below. Allocating teams is quite a complex process, but we have ensured that each of you is in a team with at least one person you asked to work with for and/or at least one person who wanted to work with you. Remaining spots were filled by optimising for teams having a diverse set of skills.\nThis discussion space is a place you can message one another and share files etc if you like. We won’t read anything that you put here, so don’t feel like you have to watch your words! Alternatively, start an email thread/whatsapp group/[insert whatever the cool kids are using to communicate these days] to be able to keep in contact outside of lab-time.\nFrom next week, in your lab (which is Lab X) we will have team names on the tables, so please go and find your team, and get to know any members of your team that you don’t already know.\nTeam Members - FIRSTNAME LASTNAME: s1234567@ed.ac.uk - FIRSTNAME LASTNAME: s1234567@ed.ac.uk - FIRSTNAME LASTNAME: s1234567@ed.ac.uk - FIRSTNAME LASTNAME: s1234567@ed.ac.uk - FIRSTNAME LASTNAME: s1234567@ed.ac.uk"

Doesn’t need to be perfect—will sand all edges down later."
