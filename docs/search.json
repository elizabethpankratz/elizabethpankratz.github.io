    "text": "In a series of posts, I’m going to share my process for crafting a pair of handsewn, hand-welted leather derby boots.\nI’m absolutely not a shoemaking expert. I’m fully self-taught, and my process is a weird melange of professional bespoke techniques and idiosyncratic hacks. But I’ve been wearing the first pair of hand-welted derby boots I made every day for nearly a year, and they’re holding up really well. So whatever I’m doing is good enough for me!\nTo create my new derby boot pattern, I’m mostly following instructions from the book Handcraft Your Own Shoes and Boots by Neda Hussain. I’ve noted other useful references and sources for shoemaking materials at the bottom of the post."

    "text": "The process\n\nCover the last (that is, the foot form) in masking tape and mark essential points.\nCut the tape off the last and stick each side flat onto paper to create the inside and outside forms.\nAverage out any wobbly bits to create the mean form.\nAdd on design lines to create the standard form.\nUsing the standard form, create pattern pieces.\n\n\n1. Taping the last\nOverall, what I’m doing here is moving from the 3D shape of a last down to a 2D representation. Covering the last in masking tape, then cutting the tape off and sticking it down flat onto some card, gives me a decent approximation of the curves and contours of the foot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are my lasts! Only one needs to be taped up if they’re approximately the same shape. I’ve augmented them with cork where my feet are wider and rasped and sanded them down where my feet are smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last covered in masking tape. I’ve marked a line down the centre of the foot (and out of view, another black line marks the centre of the heel).\n\n\nI marked the centre lines down the front and heel, as well as the “vamp point”: the widest point of the last measured from the ball of the foot across to the pinky knuckle. This is also the point where the “quarters” end and the “vamp” begins. The “quarters” are the pieces on each side of the foot and ankle that meet the strap at the centre back and hold all the eyelets for the laces on either side of the front. The “vamp” is the piece that joins the toe cap in the front, curves around the sides of the foot to lie below the quarters, and extends upwards between the quarters to make the tongue.\n\n\n2. Getting the inside and outside forms\nI also marked the “counter point” CP on the heel, sliced the tape along those two centre lines, and stuck each half down onto card and cut them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tape has been peeled off of the last and stuck down onto card. The VP (“vamp point”) and CP (“counter point”) have been marked on tthe instep and heel respectively.\n\n\nGetting the tape approximately flat is good enough for most of the foot—those wrinkles aren’t the end of the world. But small slices around the outside edge are essential to help the toe lie down smoothly.\n\n\n3. Finding the mean form\nThe mean form is so called because it’s the mean, i.e., average, of the inside and outside forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the last to the mean form: a 2D representation of its shape!\n\n\nI overlaid the inside and outside forms on another piece of card and traced around each of them. Then I marked the line that falls in between each of those outlines and cut along it (except for the bottom front of the foot—there I kept the full width of the outside form).\nI only need to do all this once. Now that I have the mean form, I can use it as the basis for every pair of shoes I design for this last from now on.\n\n\n4. Creating the standard form\nHere’s where things get design-specific and the shape of the derby boot starts to emerge!\nThis step involves tracing the mean form onto another piece of paper, marking a bunch of points in particular locations, and drawing a bunch of lines between them at specific angles and with specific lengths. I leaned heavily on the Hussain book here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard form is like the first mock-up of the shoe pattern. It’s the basis for making all the individual pattern pieces.\n\n\nOne place I diverged from the Hussain book: that book is written for making shoes using the stitch-down construction (i.e., the upper of the shoe is sewn directly onto the midsole), a construction that’s easier to sew but a lot harder to resole. I’m going to hand-welt my shoes instead (see this Shoegazing post on different construction methods). Hand-welting requires the lasting allowance around the bottom edge to be a lot more generous than stitch-down requires its seam allowance to be. I used 25 mm total.\n\n\n5. Getting the pattern pieces\nFinally, I followed the Hussain book to derive from the standard form the four pattern pieces I’ll cut from my leather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four pattern pieces for my derby boots: heel counter with back strap (top left), toe cap (top right), quarters (bottom right), and vamp (bottom left).\n\n\nFor easier tracing, I glued the paper pieces onto card (sourced from a recycled folder, hence the funny ridges!).\nThat’s all for now :)"

A piece that’s aligned with the grain doesn’t stretch, while a piece on the bias (45 degrees to the grain) does. It turns out that shoemakers have to do something similar!\nLeather hides also have stretch, but unlike fabric, this stretch goes in different directions on different parts of the hide. And the pattern pieces need to be cut from a part of the hide that puts the stretch in the right places.\nBack when I was making my first pair of shoes, I created these diagrams that summarised information about leather stretch that I found online (click to view larger).\n\n\n\nThe top diagram labels the parts of a hide—shoulder, bend, butt, and belly—and indicates which way the stretch of each part runs. The bottom diagram shows how the stretch should be laid out on the foot: you want side-to-side stretching across the front of the foot, and vertical stretching around the heel.\n\n\nTaking this stretch into account, I traced my pattern pieces using silver pen onto the hides and cut them out (again, click to view each picture larger).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leather used for the outer layer of the boot is 1.4–1.6 mm thick calf leather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had to work really hard to remember to cut two mirrored versions of each piece!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lining is &lt;1 mm thick pig skin suede velour.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’d estimate that these boots used up about five square feet each of the outer leather and of the lining leather."

But it also refers to shaving down the edges of the leather pieces in areas where they’ll overlap, so that when they’re sewn together, the final piece will have a consistent thickness.\nBeginner kits will often come with “safety skivers”, tools that put razor blades at awkward angles so they’re far away from your fingers. They may be safe, but they’re also really annoying to use. I got so fed up with my safety skivers during my last pair of boots that I went and bought this definitely-not-safety knife and a whetstone, and boy is that an improvement! A properly sharp knife actually makes skiving fun.\n\n\n\nI skived down the areas of underlay on the vamp (and the quarters, not pictured), gradually thinning the leather from about 10 mm in.\n\n\nHere’s another skiving tip that improved my life (picked up from the Carreducker blog): skive onto a glass surface.

But thanks to the reinforcement tape I’d used, the back heel of the boot didn’t totally fall apart then and there, and I was able to sew it all shut before the heel got any more damaged."

I find their technical names charming: we’ve got a heel counter and a toe puff.\nIn my last pair of boots, I used stiffeners from I Can Make Shoes that are made out of thermoplastic. They do the trick, and it’s fun to use a heat gun to shape them, but they aren’t the most robust to lots of wear. I found that the heel counter in particular has gotten some cracks. So now I’m doing what the fancy professionals do: making my own stiffeners out of leather.\nI approximated the size and shape based on the boot’s pattern pieces and cut two of each out of 3 mm thick veg tan leather. The edges have to be dramatically skived down to nearly nothing so that no lumps and bumps show through to the outside of the boot. Luckily I enjoy skiving now, so this step was actually pretty satisfying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the glass base that has improved my skiving experience so much!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I’ve glued the stiffeners onto the flesh sides of the outers."

    "section": "The insoles",
    "text": "The insoles\nThe insoles are not just the layer on which the foot will rest—they’re also the anchor that’ll hold the whole shoe together.\nThe first step is to block the insoles to the bottom of the last so that the leather begins to take on the curve of the sole. I cut some generously sized pieces of 3 mm veg tan leather, immersed them in water, let them dry until they were just a little bendy, scraped the skin side with a piece of glass (glassing removes the outermost surface to hopefully lessen squeaking as I walk), and nailed the pieces onto the last.\n\n\n\nThe veg tan leather is nailed skin side up to the insole. The nails around the edge help force the leather up against the “feather edge”, the bottom perimeter of the last.\n\n\nBeing able to find the feather edge is crucial, because the next step is to trim away the overhang. The result should be two pieces that curve along with the last’s sole and mirror the taper and flare of the feather edge.\n\n\n\nA still life of my workshop table in my favourite state: mid-task, with tools scattered everywhere. This shot shows the blocked insoles trimmed to the feather edge of the last.\n\n\nAfter trimming, I also bevelled the upper edge of the insole. Otherwise the harsh edge would be uncomfortable on my feet.\nNow to create the structure that will allow the upper to be joined to the insole: the holdfast. The holdfast is formed by relief carving into the insole, defining a ridge that runs around the bottom of the insole.\nI first marked the distance from the feather edge to where the outer edge of the holdfast should be. This distance is typically 5 mm, except it’s 10 mm at the crest of the inner waist (that is, the inside arch of the foot) and 7 mm at the outer waist, the toe, and the heel. Then I connected these points and used my dividers to mark a 6 mm strip around the whole insole.\n\n\n\nThe holdfast is 6 mm wide and encircles the entire foot. Some shoemakers anchor the heel in other ways, so this 360-degree holdfast is not ubiquitous. But I like my boots chunky, so this is what works for me!\n\n\nThen, very carefully, I carved about 1.5 mm into the insole on either side of these lines. The channel around the inner line slopes downward downward from the centre of the insole, while around the outer line, I can just cut straight in from the outside edge.\n\n\n\nFor precision cutting like this, I find it useful to switch between a craft knife and a skiving knife. Having a strop on hand to keep the blades sharp is a must. Here the 1.5 mm deep holdfasts have been carved out of the 3 mm thick insole, and unlike my previous pair of boots, I didn’t cut through to the last at all! 🥳\n\n\nI believe the professionals like Carreducker use leather that’s 6 mm thick for their insoles. The extra thickness would give a bit more leeway in carving the holdfasts, but in terms of sturdiness, even these relatively shallow holdfasts haven’t let me down.\nSoon, once the boots are lasted, I will stitch through the holdfasts and the uppers (and the welts—see below!). To prepare for the stitching, I marked around the holdfast where the thread will pass through. The stitches should be spaced about 8 mm apart on the outside of the holdfast, so they’ll cluster more tightly inside the convex curves of the toe and heel.\n\nFinally, I used my welting awl (slightly curved) to punch holes through the holdfast at every line I marked. This’ll make the stitching much easier later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe welting awl punches the paths through the holdfast that the thread will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll punched and ready for stitching!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Shoe aficionados may have encountered the term “Goodyear welted”. Goodyear welting is related to hand welting, just the holdfast is made of canvas glued to the underside of the insole, not carved out of the insole itself.)"

    "text": "Welting\n\nmost challenging part of the whole shoemaking process\npunch with the welting awl through the pre-existing holes in the holdfast, through the feather edge of the glued-down upper (which I like to mark with a silver pen), and through the welt\nthen I saddle stitch with curved upholstery needles through all of those cumbersome layers\nit took me a full Saturday to welt both boots, partially because I broke one of the curved needles and had to run to the hardware shop to get another\n\nThings I’d do differently on the next pair:\n\nIn my first pair, I put a nail through the back of the heel of the boot into the last. I didn’t do that this time because apparently it’s a controversial practice, and I wanted to see the other side. I established that it made welting around the heel a real pain, because the heel of the boot had more vertical play. So next time I will do the nail-through-the-heel again.\n\nAfter sewing on the welts, I got them wet and hammered them down on both sides so that they’re flush with the uppers on the underside and stick out at 90-ish degrees around the feather edge."
