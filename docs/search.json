I’m a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Language Evolution where I’m supervised by Prof. Jennifer Culbertson and Prof. Simon Kirby.\nMy CV (PDF)\n\nResearch\nIn my PhD, I use behavioural experiments and computational models to study\n\nhow people segment linguistic material (see Pankratz et al., 2024!),\nhow they learn rules from it,\nhow they generalise those rules to novel instances,\n\nand how those processes might shape language.\n\n\nStatistics\nI’m trained in both Bayesian and frequentist statistics, and I’m very happy to be contacted for stats/methods consulting for your project.\nLEL students at Edinburgh can book one-on-one help sessions with me (book here under “Diss stats”).\n\n\nContact\ne.c.pankratz@ed.ac.uk"

    "text": "The synthesis matrix\nImagine a spreadsheet in which every row is a book or paper you’ve read, and every column is a topic that’s important for your research. If a source says something interesting about a topic, you jot down in that column a quick note or a nice quotation.\nThen when the time comes to write a paper about “wordhood cues”, say (yknow, just hypothetically), you can revisit the notes you’ve left in the “wordhood cues” column to see everything folks have said on the topic.\nHere’s an excerpt of mine:\n \n\n\n\nBibTeX Key\nKeywords\nMain idea\nWordhood cues\n\n\n\n\nDixonAikhenvald2002a (link)\nwordhood, typology\nSeparately define both “grammatical words” and “phonological words”\nNo single phon. criterion for every language. A few gram. criteria that can work for every language.\n\n\nHaspelmath2011 (link)\nwordhood, typology\nNo criteria for wordhood are reliable cross-linguistically\nDiscusses applicability of ten (grammatical) criteria\n\n\nWray2015 (link)\nwordhood, literacy\nIntuitions about wordhood are based on orthography and on the prototype of word as concrete noun\nWord mainly as orthographic unit\n\n\n\n \nThe synthesis matrix quickly became my favourite way to manage my PhD literature.\n\nIt preserves ideas from a paper you’re reading now but may not actually cite for another three years.\nIt simplifies writing lit reviews based around ideas (like “Cats are good (Author A, Author B)”) instead of based around authors (“Author A says cats are good. Author B agrees”️).\nIt makes collaborating on lit reviews a breeze: your colleague can enter notes from a source they’ve read, and then you’ve got access to the key points too.\n\nThe problem: Entering text straight into a spreadsheet can be such a pain."
