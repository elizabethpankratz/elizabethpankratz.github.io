# Office hours and stats chats

I really like to do my office hours and stats chats **in person.**
I draw lots of little pictures to illustrate and explain things, so it's really useful for us to be able to sit together and look at the same pieces of paper.
But if you need an online meeting, we can meet over Teams too—please just let me know as far in advance as possible.
