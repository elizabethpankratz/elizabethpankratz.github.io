# Accreditation

I'm accredited as an [Associate Fellow of Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship) (AFHEA).


# Lecturing and course design

### Quantitative Methods for Linguistics and English Language

University of Edinburgh, 2023

- Created and held one guest lecture on frequentist inference and correctly interpreting p-values ([slides](https://uoelel.github.io/qml/slides/w11/#1))
- Designed the accompanying tutorial materials ([tutorial](https://uoelel.github.io/qml/tutorials/tutorial-w11.html))

### Statistics and Quantitative Methods (Bayesian)

University of Edinburgh, 2023

- Created and held three guest lectures and tutorials on modelling binary outcomes ([slides](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/sqmb/slides/w07/#1), [tutorial](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/sqmb/tutorials/tutorial-w07.html)), multiple predictors and interactions ([slides](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/sqmb/slides/w08/#1), [tutorial](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/sqmb/tutorials/tutorial-w08.html)), and continuous predictors and interactions ([slides](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/sqmb/slides/w09/#1), [tutorial](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/sqmb/tutorials/tutorial-w09.html))
- Designed formative and summative assessments


# Workshops

### Bayes, stat! A crash course in Bayesian inference

CLE retreat, 2023

- Created and held two two-hour sessions giving a conceptual and practical introduction to Bayesian modelling in R using brms ([workshop website](https://elizabethpankratz.github.io/bayes_stat/))


### Narrative design for academic storytelling

CLE retreat, 2022

- Created and held one two-hour session on the fundamentals of narrative structure and how using it can improve academic writing ([workshop booklet PDF](documents/cle-narr-booklet.pdf))

# Tutoring

*Note: Tutoring in UK higher education is like TA-ing in the North American system.*
