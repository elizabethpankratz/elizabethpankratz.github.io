# Supervision

I'm available to supervise UG and PG dissertations.

I enjoy exploring how people learn and generalise---how they move from concrete surface representations (like words and chunks) to more abstract ones (like rules and patterns).
Most of my work has focused on language, but I'm also happy to supervise projects on learning more broadly.

Please do get in touch if you're interested in working with me on any of the following topics:

- word segmentation
- rule learning
- rule generalisation
- pedagogical theory and practice
- psychology of learning


Methods I'm happy to supervise:

- behavioural experiments (especially psycholinguistic methods and artificial language learning)
- corpus studies
- computational modelling and simulation
- statistical analysis, both frequentist and Bayesian
