literature, designing and implementing experiments and models, writing everything up, preparing talks, and the PhD examination process.\n- **Teaching:** Covers tutoring, guest lecturing, my one-on-one stats chats sessions, and working toward my AFHEA accreditation.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhrs |>\n  group_by(tasktype) |>\n  summarise(hrs = sum(mins)/60) |>\n  arrange(hrs) |>\n

of teaching in early 2023 is when I stepped in to design and run the last several weeks of a PG-level Bayesian stats course.\nThat was such a fun and formative experienceâ€”it's hard to believe that it was more than half a PhD ago.\n\n\n# How many hours per research project?\n\nI conducted four research projects during the PhD, and each project makes up one content chapter in my

become [Pankratz et al., (2024)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.13429).\nFor this project, I ran one experiment in July 2022.\nThe manuscript was submitted in late 2022, and the splashes of red in 2023 were the revisions following peer review.\nThen in early 2024 came the final formatting checks, and then the paper was out!\n\nThe **Rule learning** project (yellow, Chapter 3), which I did together with [Aislinn Keogh](https://aislinnkeogh.github.io), is the longest-running project of the four.\nWe ran two experiments, one in April 2023 and one almost a year later in March 2024.\nThis project never got published, but it appears as a chapter in each of our PhD theses.\n\nThe **Rule generalisation** project (green, Chapter 4) consumed my time and my thinking for much of 2023 and well into 2024.\nI consider it the heart of my PhDâ€”it's the project I find the most interesting and the most compelling.\nWhich explains why I spent 661 hours on it!\nThe project did have some false starts, though.\nI ran one experiment for it in October 2022, but that experiment never saw the light of day because of confounds in the design that I detected too late.\nA second experiment, the one that actually appears in the thesis, was run in July 2023.\n\nFinally, the **Rule structure generalisation** project (blue, Chapter 5) was my main focus in my final year.\nFor this project, I ran four experiments within three months: one in June 2024, two in August, and one in September.\nThose four experiments were all pretty similar, but still, four experiments in three months is serious progress, considering I spent my entire first year on one single experiment!\nTurns out a PhD does actually teach you things.\nWho knew?\n\n\n# Thesis writing and viva prep\n\nIn addition to the four content chapters, my thesis contains an introduction chapter, a general discussion chapter, and a bunch of appendices.\nThe time I spent planning, writing, and revising that thesis-specific material was recorded as **Thesis** time.\n**Thesis** time also contains hours spent on LaTeX tomfoolery and on implementing the minor corrections after my viva.\n\nUnder **Viva** time, I counted the hours I spent designing my pre-viva talk (which is probably my favourite talk I've ever given) as well as doing more traditional prep for the viva itself.\nHere I'll plug Nathan Ryder's [Viva Survivors](http://viva-survivors.com) web site and workshop, and especially the [7776 Mini-Vivas resource](http://viva-survivors.com/2018/11/new-resource-7776-mini-vivas/).\nDoing a mock viva using that resource was the most useful part of my prep by a mile.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhrs |>\n  filter(tasklabel %in% c('Thesis', 'Viva')) |>\n  group_by(tasklabel) |>\n
