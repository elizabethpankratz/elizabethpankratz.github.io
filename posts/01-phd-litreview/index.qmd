Not a lot of what I did in the first year of my PhD was a great use of time...
but I did create a darn good setup for managing my literature that's paying off years later.

**The key idea: use Google Forms to build a synthesis matrix.**

&nbsp;

## The synthesis matrix

Imagine a spreadsheet in which every row is a book or paper you've read, and every column is a topic that's important for your research.
If a source says something interesting about a topic, you jot down in that column a quick note or a nice quotation.

Then when the time comes to write a [paper about "wordhood cues"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13429), say (yknow, just hypothetically), you can revisit the notes you've left in the "wordhood cues" column to see everything folks have said on the topic.

Here's an excerpt of mine:

&nbsp;

| BibTeX Key | Keywords | Main idea | Wordhood cues |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| DixonAikhenvald2002a [(link)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/word/word-a-typological-framework/F1E7F35DBCF3AB56C322E6F83EAD2117) | wordhood, typology | Separately define both "grammatical words" and "phonological words" | No single phon. criterion for every language. A few gram. criteria that can work for every language. |
| Haspelmath2011 [(link)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/flin.2011.002/html?lang=en)  | wordhood, typology | No criteria for wordhood are reliable cross-linguistically    |  Discusses applicability of ten (grammatical) criteria |
| Wray2015 [(link)](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/38609/chapter-abstract/334738347?redirectedFrom=fulltext) | wordhood, literacy | Intuitions about wordhood are based on orthography and on the prototype of word as concrete noun | Word mainly as orthographic unit |

&nbsp;

The synthesis matrix quickly became my favourite way to manage my PhD literature.

- It preserves ideas from a paper you're reading now but may not actually cite for another three years.
- It simplifies writing lit reviews based around ideas (like "Cats are good (Author A, Author B)") instead of based around authors ("Author A says cats are good. Author B agrees"Ô∏è).
- It makes collaborating on lit reviews a breeze: your colleague can enter notes from a source they've read, and then you've got access to the key points too.

The problem: Entering text straight into a spreadsheet can be *such a pain*.


## Enter: Google Forms

With Google Forms (or Microsoft Forms, or probably many others‚Äîpick your poison), you can create a "survey" that contains a bunch of text fields, each corresponding to a piece of information that you want to record.

![](litreview2.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

Then once you submit this form, the text you entered in each field will be saved as a new row in a spreadsheet.

![](syn-mtx.png){width=90% fig-align="center"}

If you decide after creating the form that you want to start taking notes on a new topic, then it's as easy as editing the form to add a new question.
A new column will automatically be added into the spreadsheet.


## What to record?

For each source, I record:

- **BibTeX key**
- **Topics/keywords**
- **Main idea**
- **Data/evidence/method used** (e.g., "experiment", "review paper", "narrative argumentation")
- **Overall impression** (e.g., "has great lit review", "hard to follow")
- **Followup lit** (any papers that are mentioned that I should go read)
- **Followup ideas** (questions/ideas that this source raises)

Then I also have many optional questions about the different research topics that I'm interested in, for example:

- **Wordhood cues**
- **Rule generalisation**
- **Emergence of compositional structure**

Of course not every source weighs in on every topic. 
I just take notes under the topics that are relevant.

This literature management method has really helped me, and I hope it can help somebody else out there!
Happy synthesising üòä
