I wanted a simple wallet that would hold my day-to-day cards and keys, as well as an airtag. 
This post shares a downloadable PDF of the pattern I came up with.

**Wallet specs:**

- Dimensions with wings folded in: approx 118mm *  70mm * 22mm.
- Easily holds an airtag, a handful of keys, and up to four cards. 


**Materials I used:**

- **Leather:** 1.2–1.4mm-thick undyed veg tan leather. I used scraps left over from my barefoot boots, or the wallet requires one A4/letter-sized sheet.
- **Thread:** Mercerised crochet cotton from a charity shop, waxed before sewing.
- **Snaps:** Prym 15mm snaps, 2x front (the receiving end) and 2x back (the inserting end). Smaller snaps would also work fine.
