If a source says something interesting about a topic, you jot down in that column a quick note or a nice quotation.\nThen when the time comes to write a paper about “wordhood cues”, say (yknow, just hypothetically), you can revisit the notes you’ve left in the “wordhood cues” column to see everything folks have said on the topic.\nHere’s an excerpt of mine:\n \n\n\n\nBibTeX Key\nKeywords\nMain idea\nWordhood cues\n\n\n\n\nDixonAikhenvald2002a (link)\nwordhood, typology\nSeparately define both “grammatical words” and “phonological words”\nNo single phon. criterion for every language.

Author B agrees”️).\nIt makes collaborating on lit reviews a breeze: your colleague can enter notes from a source they’ve read, and then you’ve got access to the key points too.\n\nThe problem: Entering text straight into a spreadsheet can be such a pain."
